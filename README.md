## Experience Gained

- Developed an interactive Tenzies dice game using React for component-based architecture, enabling efficient UI updates and state management.
- Employed useState to manage and derive values for game states including: current set of dice and their values, dice “held” status and game completion status
- Implemented useEffect to detect game-winning condition automatically and trigger side effects such as focusing “new game” button
- Added functionality for rolling dice selectively, tracking game statistics, and providing visual feedback for held dice.
- Applied modular React components for dice elements and control buttons, improving code maintainability and reusability.
